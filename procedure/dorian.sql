-- Set counties with no points to 0 for the november count
-- Calculate the normalized difference tweet index (made this up, based on NDVI), where
-- ndti = (tweets about storm â€“ baseline twitter activity) / (tweets about storm + baseline twitter activity)
-- remember to multiply something by 1.0 so that you'll get decimal devision, not integer division
-- also if the denominator would end up being 0, set the result to 0

-- Either in QGIS or in R...
-- Map the normalized tweet difference index for Hurricane Dorian
-- Try using the heatmap symbology in QGIS to visualize kernel density of tweets
